//@23967 - change Blunt Weapons to Mace
@200001 = ~Mace +2 : 'Krotan's Skullcrusher'
Even the hordes have their heroes, and while they are vilified in civilized company, their deeds are sometimes impressive nonetheless. Krotan was an exceptionally intelligent orc, as far as orcs go, who commanded an ever-shifting legion of ogres, orcs, hobgoblins, and other assorted beasties during the Year of the Lost Lady, 1241DR. It was in this year that a group of orc bandits allegedly kidnapped and killed a Tethyrian noblewoman, and the response from authorities was a genocidal slaughter of orcs throughout the south in her memory. Krotan mounted a defense that ensured his people were not entirely destroyed; though they were displaced. Krotan himself fell near the end of the conflict, and his head was mounted outside the graveyard where the young lady was buried. As a point of interest, orcs called this time the "Year of Pushing Too Far."

//@7350 - change Bow Weapons to Long Bow
@200002 = ~Long bow of marksmanship:  'The Dead Shot'
Driven by years of rivalry, the Dukes of Spandeliyon and Delthuntle decided to organize a private contest that would proclaim the better archer between them.  Both boasted the power of their magical bows, but that wasn't enough for Edwall Dest, Duke of Spandeliyon.  He arranged for the theft of his opponent's bow, and on the day of the contest he couldn't help gloat in his advantage.  The Duke of Delthuntle, known only as Raymond, demanded a demonstration of Edwall's skill on a scarecrow that he had placed.  Edwall Dest drew his longbow and released the arrow with determination, not stopping to think how uncannily the target resembled himself.  The missile split the large voodoo doll's head in twain, and at that moment Edwall's head did much the same.

//@7351 = change Bow Weapons to Short Bow
@200003  = ~Short bow, eagle bow:  'Protector of the Dryads'
In order to protect their community from an encroaching orc logging encampment, the hero Hannable the White was given this magnificent bow by the dryads of Gulthmere Forest.  A deadly confrontation followed when the loggers dared to try and cut down a great oak tree, nearly killing the dryad linked to it.  With the help of powerful forest animals Hannable slew entire bands of orcs before any more damage was inflicted upon the wood.  The orcs were forced to abandon their plans, lest they suffer the continued wrath of Hannable and the forest.  Needless to say, the hero who aided the grateful dryads lived happily... nay, VERY happily ever after!

As you have no memory of her, nor any keepsakes to remind you of her existence, you have come to believe that she died while giving birth to you.
